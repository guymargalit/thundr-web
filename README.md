## Introduction

Thundr is an app that lets you visualize your Spotify music with LIFX Wi-Fi LED lights. 

A Spotify account is required along with at least one LIFX Wi-Fi LED light. Thundr will sync with the song currently playing and use Spotify's audio analysis to send different colors and effects to your lights. This project is a work in progress and is still being actively developed.

This repository is the website for Thundr and is built in React.
