<p align="center"><b>Connect musical instruments to Wi-Fi enabled LED smart lights.</b></p>

Initially, this application was an attempt at using the LIFX API to create light shows. A rewrite is essential as it used the HTTP API and was too slow. Therefore, the application will now be written in Python through LAN and will support MIDI instruments.

The previous code is still available in the website folder.

TODO

-   Change from HTTP request to LAN
-   Add support for ROLI Seaboard
-   Add keyboard support
